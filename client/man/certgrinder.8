.sp
The \fBcertgrinder\fP client is responsible for generating a keypair and a CSR, which it uses to contact the Certgrinder server \fBcertgrinderd\fP over SSH to get a signed certificate. The following section explains how to install and configure it to get certificates from the Certgrinder server.
.SH INSTALLATION
.sp
This section explains the steps to install a Certgrinder client. Repeat these steps on each server in need of certificates!
.SS Install certgrinder
.sp
You can install certgrinder from pip with \fBpip install certgrinder\fP\&. This will install the latest \fBcertgrinder\fP release. It will pull in the dependencies it needs automatically.
.sp
You can also checkout the Github repo and install the deps from requirements.txt by hand if you prefer. If you want to install with pip directly from Git the following may help:
\fBpip install "git+https://github.com/tykling/certgrinder/#egg=certgrinder&subdirectory=client"\fP
.SS Create Certgrinder User
.sp
Since \fBcertgrinder\fP is designed to be run under a separate system user one should be created. The user needs sudo access if (and only if) it is to be able to reload/restart services after renewing certificates. Sometimes it is also necessary to add some system users to the certgrinder group so they can read certificates. More on that later.
.sp
The user also needs to run \fBssh\-keygen\fP and the SSH key needs to be added to the \fBauthorized_keys\fP file on the Certgrinder server. Make sure to test the SSH access works (hint: check firewalls, v4 vs v6 etc).
.SS Configuration
.sp
Configuration of \fBcertgrinder\fP can be done using command\-line options, or a configuration file, or a combination of the two.
.sp
The \fBcertgrinder\fP configuration file is in YAML format. An example config named \fBcertgrinder.conf.dist\fP can be found in the distribution. use \fB\-\-config\-file\fP or \fB\-f\fP to specify the config file location.
.sp
Each config item can be specified either in the YAML config file as a \fBkey: value\fP pair, or on the commandline as \fB\-\-key value\fP \- the latter overriding the former if both are present. For example, if the configfile has \fBlog\-level: INFO\fP and the command\-line has \fB\-\-log\-level: DEBUG\fP then the effective log\-level would be \fBDEBUG\fP\&.
.sp
This is an alphabetical list of the configurable options:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fIcertgrinderd\fP
The command to run as \fBcertgrinderd\fP\&. Usually this will be something like \fBssh certgrinderd@certgrinder.example.com \-T\fP, possibly also with a \fB\-\-config\-file\fP for \fBcertgrinderd\fP if needed.
.sp
Default: \fBNone\fP
.TP
.B \fIcert\-renew\-threshold\-days\fP
A certificate will be renewed when it has less than this many days of lifetime left.
.sp
Default: \fB30\fP
.TP
.B \fIdomain\-list\fP
Comma\-separated lists of domains for the certificates. Can be specified multiple times on the command\-line, \fB\-\-domain\-list example.com,www.example.com \-\-domain\-list example.net\fP means two certificates, the first with two names, the second with one name.
.sp
Default: \fBNone\fP
.TP
.B \fIinvalid\-ca\-cn\-list\fP
List of CommonName of certificate issuers to consider invalid. This is not a regular CA certificate validity check, it is used to detect certificates issued by LetsEncrypt staging servers as invalid.
.sp
Default: \fB["Fake LE Intermediate X1", "Fake LE Intermediate X2"]\fP
.TP
.B \fIlog\-level\fP
Sets the verbosity level for console and syslog logging. One of DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL.
.sp
Default: \fBINFO\fP
.TP
.B \fIkey\-type\-list\fP
List of key types to enable. Supported choices are \fIrsa\fP and \fIecdsa\fP\&. Files for each keytype will be suffixed with \fI\&.rsa.ext\fP and \fIecdsa.ext\fP, respectively.
.sp
Default: \fB["rsa", "ecdsa"]\fP
.TP
.B \fIname\-server\fP
Set this to a DNS server IP (v4 or v6, no hostnames) to use that DNS server instead of the system resolver.
.sp
Default: \fBNone\fP
.TP
.B \fIocsp\-renew\-threshold\-percent\fP
The amount of time in percent between \fBproduced_at\fP and \fBnext_update\fP that must have passed before an OCSP response is considered too old. As of January 2021 LetsEncrypt has 7 days between \fBproduced_at\fP and \fBnext_update\fP in OCSP responses, so the default of 50% means OCSP responses will be renewed after 3.5 days (half of the validity period) has passed.
.sp
As of January 2021 LetsEncrypt produces new OCSP responses after half of the validity period has passed, so any setting lower than that will be pointless. Setting this lower than 50 will just result in Certgrinder fetching the same OCSP response over and over.
.sp
Set to 0 to always renew OCSP responses regardless of their age.
.sp
Default: \fB50\fP
.TP
.B \fIpath\fP
The directory used for keys, CSRs and certificates. Must exist and be writable by the user running Certgrinder.
.sp
Default: \fBNone\fP
.TP
.B \fIperiodic\-sleep\-minutes\fP
Certgrinder will pick a random number of minutes between 0 and this number and sleep for that long before doing periodic actions. Set to 0 to disable sleeping.
.sp
Default: \fB60\fP
.TP
.B \fIpid\-dir\fP
The directory to place the certgrinderd PID file in.
.sp
Default: \fB/tmp\fP
.TP
.B \fIpost\-renew\-hooks\fP
A list of commands which \fBcertgrinder\fP must run after renewing one or more certificates. Use this to reload/restart services which need to be poked after the certificate changes. Can be specified multiple times on the command\-line. Remember to include sudo or whatever if needed.
.sp
Default: \fBNone\fP
.TP
.B \fIstaging\fP
Enable staging mode. Adds \fB\-\-staging\fP to the \fBcertgrinderd\fP command, and sees certificates issued by LE staging servers as valid.
.sp
Default: \fBFalse\fP
.TP
.B \fIsyslog\-facility\fP
Set this and syslog\-socket to enable logging to syslog. Must be a value supported by \fBlogging.handlers.SysLogHandler\fP like \fBLOG_USER\fP or \fBLOG_LOCAL0\fP\&.
.sp
Default: \fBNone\fP
.TP
.B \fIsyslog\-socket\fP
Set this and syslog\-facility to enable logging to syslog.
.sp
Default: \fBNone\fP
.TP
.B \fItlsa\-port\fP
Set this to the port (like \fB443\fP) when using \fBshow tlsa\fP or \fBcheck tlsa\fP subcommands.
.sp
Default: \fBNone\fP
.TP
.B \fItlsa\-protocol\fP
Set this to the protocol (like \fBtcp\fP) when using \fBshow tlsa\fP or \fBcheck tlsa\fP subcommands.
.sp
Default: \fBNone\fP
.TP
.B \fItlsa\-type\-list\fP
Set this to enable a TLSA type (can be specified multiple times). The TLSA type must be specified as three integers, one of: \fB310\fP, \fB311\fP or \fB312\fP\&. Default: is all three pubkey types.
.sp
Default: \fB["310", "311", "312"]\fP
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS ACME Challenges
.sp
Finally you need to choose which challenge type to use for this \fBcertgrinder\fP client. If \fBDNS\-01\fP you need to create one or more \fBCNAME\fP record pointing somewhere. If \fBHTTP\-01\fP you need to create an HTTP redirect. See the section on challenges for more info.
.SS Testing
.sp
At this point you should be ready to test! Start by checking with SSH manually to see that the SSH key is installed properly on the Certgrinder server, and firewalls are open. Certgrinder has a \fB\-\-staging\fP switch which makes \fBcertgrinderd\fP use the LetsEncrypt staging environment. Use this until everything works! \fBcertgrinder\fP outputs some info on what happens, and can output more with \fB\-d / \-\-debug\fP, but sometimes you need to check syslog on the Certgrinder server.
.SS Crontab job
.sp
I run Certgrinder daily, although it only attempts renewal when less than 30 days validity remains. When everything above works it is time to automate it by adding it to crontab. The following line works for me (I vary the times between servers):
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
48 2 * * * certgrinder /usr/home/certgrinder/virtualenv/bin/certgrinder \-f /usr/home/certgrinder/certgrinder.yml
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Note that I call it inside the virtualenv directly to make sure the correct environment is used!
.SH CLIENT COMMANDS
.sp
All the functionality in Certgrinder can be accessed by using \fBcommands\fP and \fBsubcommands\fP\&. The following \fBcommands\fP are available:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%check certificate command\fP

.UNINDENT
.SS check commands
.sp
All the subcommands for the \fBcheck\fP commands return exit code 1 if a problem is found and 0 if everything is fine.
.SS check certificate command
.sp
The \fBcheck certificate\fP subcommand loops over the configured domainsets and checks the validity of the certificate for each. If a problem is found \fBcertgrinder\fP will exit with exit code 1, if all is well the exit code will be 0.
.SS check connection command
.sp
The \fBcheck connection\fP subcommand simply checks that the connection to the \fBcertgrinderd\fP server works as expected. It calls the \fBping\fP command on the \fBcertgrinderd\fP server and expects to see the string \fBpong\fP on stdout. If the expected string is found the exit code will be 0, if a problem is found the exit code will be 1.
.SS check ocsp command
.sp
The \fBcheck ocsp\fP subcommand loops over the configured domainsets and checks for the existance of an OCSP response for each. If an OCSP response for a certificate is missing or too old \fBcertgrinder\fP will exit with exit code 1, if all is well the exit code will be 0.
.sp
An OCSP response is considered too old when more than \fBocsp\-renew\-threshold\-percent\fP percent of the time between \fBproducedAt\fP and \fBnextUpdate\fP has passed. As of January 2021 LetsEncrypt has 7 days (one week) between \fBproducedAt\fP and \fBnextUpdate\fP which means OCSP responses will be renewed after 3.5 days with the default \fBocsp\-renew\-threshold\-percent\fP setting of \fB50\fP\&.
.SS check tlsa command
.sp
The \fBcheck tlsa\fP subcommand is like the \fBshow tlsa\fP subcommand but it goes one step further and actually checks in the \fBDNS\fP if the records could be found, and prints some output accordingly. The following example shows two runs of \fBcheck tlsa\fP mode. The first run finds no TLSA records and outputs what needs to be added:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5

.SS get commands
.sp
The \fBget\fP subcommands do all the real work.
.SS get certificate command
.sp
The \fBget certificate\fP subcommand loops over the configured domainsets and gets a new certificate for each, regardless of the current status of existing certificates. Use with care, only for troubleshooting. \fIDo not use from cron. Use the periodic command instead.\fP
.SS get ocsp command
.sp
The \fBget ocsp\fP subcommand loops over the configured domainsets and gets a new OCSP response for each, regardless of the current status of existing OCSP responses. \fIDo not use from cron. Use the periodic command instead.\fP
.SS help command
.sp
The \fBhelp\fP command is just a shortcut for \fB\-h\fP which shows commandline usage and help.
.SS periodic command
.sp
The \fBperiodic\fP command sleeps for a random number of minutes between 0 and the config setting \fBperiodic\-sleep\-minutes\fP before doing anything. Set this setting to 0 to disable sleeping.
.sp
After sleeping the certificates and OCSP responses are checked and renewed as needed. This command is meant to be run daily from cron or similar.
.SS show commands
.sp
The \fBshow\fP subcommands show information but never change anything.
.SS show certificate command
.sp
The \fBshow certificate\fP subcommand loops over configured domainsets and outputs information about each certificate (if any).
.SS show configuration command
.sp
The \fBshow configuration\fP subcommand just dumps the active configuration as a pretty printed JSON object and exits. Useful for testing or debugging configuration issues.
.SS show ocsp command
.sp
The \fBshow ocsp\fP subcommand loops over the configured domainsets and shows info about each OCSP response.
.SS show paths command
.sp
The \fBshow paths\fP subcommand loops over the configured domainsets and outputs the paths used for keys, certificates and OCSP responses.
.SS show spki command
.sp
The \fBshow spki\fP subcommand outputs pin\-sha256 spki pins for the public keys. The \fBHPKP\fP standard \fI\%https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Public_Key_Pinning\fP defined the \fBpin\-sha256\fP format for public key pins. While the \fBHPKP\fP standard didn\(aqt get much traction the pinning format is used in various places now, so \fBcertgrinder\fP can generate them.
